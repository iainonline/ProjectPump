WELCOME TO PROJECT PUMP

The purpose of this project is to create a machine which can help users learn how to 'pump' on a skateboard or other means of human powered transportation.

The initial proposal is for a device to help teach a skateboarder to pump on a half pipe, bowl environment or pump track.

The concept could be applied further to a much wider field including:

- Foil boarders in water who pump their boards to create the energy needed to move forward
- Long boarders who practice long distance pumping
- Snow boarders and skiers who may wish to minimize or maximize their energy inputs from changes in elevation
- Surfers who pump to gain energy on the waves whilst surfing
- BMX riders who ride on pump tracks, bowls, half pipes or anywhere else
